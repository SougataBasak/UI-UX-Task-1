## REDESIGN A WEBSITE LANDING PAGE - Task 1

SalesNOW landing page offers a significantly improved user experience through a modern, clean, and conversion-focused layout. The hero section now features a clear and benefit-driven headline with simplified background visuals, allowing the call-to-action buttons like “Try Now” and “Login” to stand out clearly. This immediately directs user attention and encourages engagement. The product demo is repositioned more prominently with a dedicated “Watch Video” section, improving early interaction and interest. Feature highlights have been transformed into visually consistent cards with icons and bold headings, making information easier to scan and understand. Unlike the original page’s cluttered and text-heavy format, the redesign emphasizes clarity and structure, also elevated trust-building elements by introducing a dedicated testimonial section with real user photos and short, authentic quotes—helping build emotional connection and credibility early in the experience. Pricing and plan details are now cleaner and more transparent, using a central layout that outlines exactly what’s included in a visually appealing format. The addition of colorful feature cards further showcases the product’s value while enhancing scannability. Lastly, the footer is more organized, clearly structured with links, contact information, and trust badges, which boosts the overall professionalism of the page.

Overall, My redesign improves visual hierarchy, readability, engagement, and mobile adaptability—ensuring users can explore the platform confidently and take action with ease.
